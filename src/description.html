				<p>GO-ON® is a Class III medical device approved by Health Canada consisting of a sterile non-pyrogenic Hyaluronic Acid preparation for intra-articular administration into the joints to help lubricate and cushion the joints. GO-ON® is administered 3 to 5 times at weekly intervals and can provide up to six months of pain relief and improved mobility. </p>

				<p>GO-ON® is a Class III medical device, distributed by Xediton Pharmaceutical Inc. in Canada, consisting of a sterile non-pyrogenic HA preparation for IA administration (2.5 ml of 1% sodium hyaluronate solution, contained in a disposable sterile 5-ml syringe). The main characteristics of GO-ON® are (i) Its Source of Hyaluronic Acid (ii) Its Molecular Weight (iii) Its Concentration </p>

				<strong><span class="arrow-right"></span>Source of Hyaluronic Acid (HA)</strong>
				<p>Some hyaluronic acid treatments for joint osteoarthritis are made from rooster combs and others are derived from bacterial fermentation. Both sources have provided highly purified Hyaluronic Acid preparations, devoid of any immunogenic side-effects. Potential concerns about viral outbreaks, particularly insidious in the avian species, may however suggest some precaution in adopting Hyaluronic Acid preparations from animal sources. GO-ON® is a biosynthetic product, the HA contained in GO-ON® is extracted from Streptococcus Equi by fermentation processes and subsequent purifications. The non-animal source and the highly standardized purification process guarantee not only the absence of immunogenic reactions but also safety from animal, namely avian virus contamination. </p><br>

				<strong><span class="arrow-right"></span>Molecular weight</strong>
				<p>	While HA preparations extracted from animal tissue may be affected in terms of consistency of “molecular weight” by the different types and origin of the animal organs (e.g. rooster combs) utilized, HA of biosynthetic origin can be produced with an established and consistent grade of polymerization. In particular, the final “average molecular weight” of the HA preparation can be tailored to reach a desired degree of viscosity. High viscosity may result in pain upon injection. Hyaluronic Acid preparations for visco-supplementation should therefore aim at medium-level viscosity (about 1 million Daltons), where a balance between the advantages and potential adverse events can be maintained. The average MW of GO-ON® is 1.4 million Daltons. This particular range of MW is considered optimal to favour the natural synthesis of HA.</p><br>

				<strong><span class="arrow-right"></span>Concentration</strong>
				<p>GO-ON® is characterized by its intrinsic viscosity (mostly related to its MW), at a fixed concentration of 10 mg HA /ml. Due to the unique colloid-osmotic properties of HA, this is the ideal concentration. If HA is injected at significantly higher concentrations, it will be diluted within hours to concentrations around 10 mg/ml, balancing the colloid-osmotic pressure with the interstitial fluids (10 mmHg). As a consequence, the initial intrinsic viscosity of a HA preparation at concentrations higher than 10 mg/ml will be significantly reduced, with unwanted loss of its viscoelastic properties. 
				GO-ON® is manufactured from safe sources and its ideal MW properties demonstrate that it is the best product for visco-supplementation of the knee OA.
				</p><br>
				<strong><span class="arrow-right"></span>No Cross-linkages</strong>
				<p>Hyaluronic acid cross–linked preparations are developed with high molecular weight and high viscosity properties.  Some of these high molecular weight products have used bridge molecules or “links” to achieve this. The main reason why Hyaluronic Acid can be safely injected in humans is related to the complete absence of immunogenic potential. All “bridge-molecules” are foreign to the body and should be carefully evaluated, for potential safety concerns. GO-ON® has no cross-linked molecules</p><br>
