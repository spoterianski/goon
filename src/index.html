					<h2>Osteoarthritis</h2>
					<p>
						Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent kind of arthritis, affecting more than four million Canadians. <span class="red">This is characterized by the degradation of cartilage, a tough, elastic material, which covers and protects the ends of bones. </span><br>
						Cartilage is an essential component of the joints. It acts as a shock absorber, and also enables the joint to move smoothly. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With Osteoarthritis, the cartilage erodes, eventually resulting in pain,stiffness, swelling and bone-on-bone movement in the affected joint.
