					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>What is GO-ON® (sodium hyaluronate)?</strong>
					<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">GO-ON® is a product from the class of products known as hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, or hyaluronans. It is approved for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee, hip and shoulder in patients who do not get adequate relief from simple painkillers or from exercise and physical therapy.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>How is GO-ON® administered?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">GO-ON® is administered by intra-articular injection into the knee joint.</p><br>
				</div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>How does GO-ON® work?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">The fluid (synovial fluid) in your knee helps to lubricate and cushion the joint during movement. The major component in the synovial fluid is hyaluronic acid. One of the early effects of osteoarthritis (OA) is the breakdown of this fluid, making it less effective. GO-ON® injection helps restore the synovial fluid back to a more healthy state, thereby reducing the pain of osteoarthritis.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Why is my doctor recommending GO-ON®?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">GO-ON® is indicated for patients with osteoarthritis knee pain who do not obtain adequate relief from simple painkillers, like acetaminophen, or from exercise and physical therapy. Ask your doctor for additional information and discuss your treatment options.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Is GO-ON® approved for use in Canada?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">GO-ON® is approved by Health Canada as a viscoelastic supplementation for synovial fluid in the knee, hip and shoulder joints. The actions of the product are lubrication and mechanical support and it is well suited for treatment of the symptoms of osteoarthritis.
				GO-ON® has a favourable safety profile, with over 6 million doses administered worldwide.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>What is GO-ON® made from?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Hyaluronic acid is a natural chemical found in almost all species and various parts of your body. It is particularly high in joint tissues and in the fluid that fills the knee joint (synovial fluid). </p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span></span>How different is GO-ON® from other Hyaluronic Acid products?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Compared to most marketed Sodium Hyaluronate preparations, which originate from rooster combs, GO-ON® contains Sodium Hyaluronate obtained from Streptococcus Equi by fermentation processes and subsequent purification. 
				The biosynthetic (fermentative) origin is more advantageous than the extractive origin because of tolerability reasons, i.e. elimination of any risk of antibody reactions and consequent inflammatory processes and virus safety.  </p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span></span>Will my insurance cover GO-ON®?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">As each insurance plan is different, it is an employer’s decision to include coverage for visco-supplementation. More information can be found in your Employee Benefit Booklet or your Extended Health Benefits section under Medical Services and Supplies.
				Some insurers allow the category “visco-supplementation” or “synovial fluid replacement” products to be processed directly at the pharmacy using the drug card. The pharmacy must use the appropriate Pseudo DIN (Drug Identification Number). All products in this category do not have a Drug Identification Number (DIN), but rather a Pseudo-DIN or PIN. GO-ON®’s Pseudo DIN or PIN is 96599969
				Other insurers require patients to pay for the product and then submit the receipt and claim form to their insurance company. Please include all necessary details including Product Name, Pseudo DIN or PIN to expedite your claim.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span></span>Why are three or more injections required?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Single-injection options are products manipulated to increase the Molecular Weight and viscosity to permit only one injection per course. Preparations with higher viscosity are associated with higher local pain during injections.
				A higher viscosity is obtained by chemical procedures that include the presence of cross-linked molecules to increase the Molecular Weight. The presence of cross-linked molecules can generate immunogenic potential effects. 
				The average Molecular Weight of GO-ON® is 1.4 million Daltons.  This accommodates a balance between the advantages and potential adverse events, and contains no cross- linked molecules. </p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span></span>How do I know if GO-ON® is right for me?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">A doctor is the best person to advise you on any course of treatment. GO-ON® is approved for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee, hip and shoulder in patients who do not get adequate relief from simple painkillers or from exercise and physician therapy.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Can I take other medications with GO-ON®?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Because GO-ON® is injected directly into the joint and not administered systemically, and there are no known drug interactions, you may be able to take other medications as well. It is specifically not known to interfere with other pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs. The safety and effectiveness of the use of GO-ON® concomitantly with other intra-articular injections, such as steroids, have not been established. You should discuss all of your current medications and vitamin supplements with your physician on a periodic basis.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Can I receive GO-ON® in both of my knees?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Yes, if both knees have pain. GO-ON® treatment may be given in both knees simultaneously or separately, according to your physician’s recommendations. Because GO-ON® is only injected locally into the knee joint and not administered systemically, it is not likely that injections into one knee will have an effect of both of your knees.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Should I modify my level of physical activity after receiving GO-ON® treatment?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">It is recommended that you avoid strenuous activities such as jogging, tennis, and heavy lifting for at least 48 hours after receiving an injection. Your doctor will advise about what level of activity is right for you, but in general, patients are able to maintain their normal daily activities after receiving GO-ON® treatment.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>How often can GO-ON® be injected into my knee?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">The number of courses/injections is a decision you and your doctor need to make. Your doctor may recommend three to five GO-ON® injections and repeat treatment based upon their clinical assessment and discussions with you. Studies show that retreatment with GO-ON® is usually useful after six months of the previous course.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Can GO-ON® be used in joints other than the knee?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">In general, use of visco-supplementation with HA for joints other than the knee is not usual. The majority of visco-supplementation of hyaluronic acid for joints is in the knee.  In Canada, GO-ON® is approved by Health Canada as viscoelastic supplementation for synovial fluid in knee, shoulder and hip. There are several publications that report favourable data for visco-supplementation in hip and shoulder joints.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Is GO-ON® a cure for osteoarthritis of the knee?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">There is no cure for osteoarthritis. GO-ON® is a treatment for the symptoms of knee, hip and shoulder pain of osteoarthritis.
				</p><br></div>
				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>When can I expect to experience pain relief?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Each patient’s response to GO-ON® may vary, depending on severity of your osteoarthritis, degree of pain, and pre-existing medical conditions. In some patients, successful treatment may reduce pain within the first week after treatment begins. However, based upon clinical trials, most patients experienced pain relief after their third injection of GO-ON®.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>What are the benefits of receiving GO-ON® treatment?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Successful treatment with GO-ON® should reduce pain in an osteoarthritic knee, resulting in increased mobility. Because it is a local treatment, GO-ON® should not interfere with any medicine that the patient may take.
				</p><br></div>
				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>How long can I expect the benefits of GO-ON® to last?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Each patient reacts differently to GO-ON® treatment. Three to five injections given at weekly intervals can provide most patients with long lasting pain relief for up to 6 months. The duration of pain relief you experience may vary. Some patients may experience benefit with three injections given at weekly intervals.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>How safe is GO-ON®?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Worldwide, over 4,193,467 GO-ON® sales were accounted for during January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011.
				During the 5-year period, a total of 40 safety complaints were reported following GO-ON® treatment and only 14 were classified as incidents. The percentage of total safety complaints occurred with GO-ON® in the 5-year period can be considered negligible and most of safety complaints are foreseeable in the GO-ON Instructions for Use. 
				Reactions may occur rarely; however, this is mitigated by the requirement that GO-ON® must be administered by a qualified medical practitioner, resulting in a risk consequence classification of marginal. 
				GO-ON® should only be used by qualified persons who are familiar with its use. In order to safely administer GO-ON®, the doctor must strictly follow the instructions for use and the warnings and precautions indicated in the product Information.  
				</p><br></div>
				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>What are the side effects of GO-ON®?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Because GO-ON® is injected directly into the joint, some patients may feel localized discomfort after treatment. Some pain, swelling, and effusion may occur in and around the knee. Both usually go away within a short period and do not interfere with the success of the treatment. If you continue to feel discomfort or notice other problems, you should consult your physician.</p><br></div>

				<div class="block-lists-collapse" data-role="collapse-list">
					<strong class="show-list-item"><span class="arrow-right"></span>Are there any allergies that may affect GO-ON® treatment?</strong>
				<p class="collapse-block collapse-list-item">Products containing hyaluronic acid made from rooster or chicken combs must be used cautiously due to potential concerns about viral outbreaks, particularly insidious in the avian species. 
				GO-ON® is a biosynthetic product, the hyaluronic acid contained in GO-ON® is extracted from bacteria (Streptococcus Equi) by fermentation processes and subsequent purifications. The non-animal source and the highly standardized purification process guarantee not only the absence of immunogenic reactions but also safety from avian virus contamination. 
				The biosynthetic (fermentative) origin of hyaluronic acid contained in GO-ON® guarantees safety from viral infections and eliminates any risk of antibody reactions and consequent inflammatory processes that, by the contrary, may occur with products containing hyaluronic acid of extractive origin (rooster combs).
								GO-ON® is a safe product for viscoelastic supplementation for synovial fluid in the knee and other synovial joints of osteoarthritic patients.</p><br></div>
